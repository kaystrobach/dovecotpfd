/**
* Dovecot Password File Driver (dovecotpfd)
*
* Roundcube password plugin driver that adds functionality to change passwords stored in
* Dovecot passwd/userdb files (see: http://wiki.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/PasswdFile)

*
*
* SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
*
*  - PHP 5.3.0 or higher, shell access and the ability to run php scripts from the CLI
*
*  - chgdovecotpw and dovecotpfd-setuid.c (these two files should have been bundled with this driver)
*
*  - dovecotpfd-setuid.c must be compiled and the resulting dovecotpfd-setuid binary placed in the same directory
*    as this script (see dovecotpfd-setuid.c source for compilation instructions, security info and options)
*
*  - chgdovecotpw must be placed in a location where dovecotpfd-setuid can access it once it has changed UID (normally /usr/sbin is a good choice)
*
*  - chgdovecotpw should only be executable by the user dovecotpfd-setuid changes UID to
*
*  - the dovecot passwd/userdb file must be accessible and writable by the same user dovecotpfd-setuid changes UID to
*
*  - dovecotpw (usually packaged with dovecot itself and found in /usr/sbin) must be available and executable by chgdovecotpw
*
