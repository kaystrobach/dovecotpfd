   dovecotpfd-setuid (http://code.google.com/p/dovecotpfd/)

   Simple C wrapper to allow running chgdovecotpw as a specific user. This wrapper is necessary as linux
   prevents scripts from changing uid themselves (see: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22890)

// Set the UID this script will change user to. For security reasons do not set this to 0 (i.e. root).
// Instead, create a new user, specify the uid of this new user here and then make this user the owner
// of the dovecot passwd/userdb file and the chgdovecotpw script. This user should be the only one who
// can execute the chgdovecotpw script and write to the dovecot passwd/userdb file.
